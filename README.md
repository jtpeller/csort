# csort

## What

Static library I'm building to get re-acquainted with C/C++. 
Created with Visual Studio 2022.

## How

I've got a repository [here](https://github.com/jtpeller/csort_test) that uses this library. Similar to my gosort repository, it measures the running times of the various sort functions.

## Important notes

I'm getting re-acquainted with C/C++, so this code probably has a few bad practices.
Also, I've never built a library before, so that's probably got some bad practices as well.
These will hopefully be fixed over time.
