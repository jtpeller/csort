# csort

Static library built in C/C++ that I built to get re-acquainted with the language.

## Purpose

This is a library of five sorting algorithms meant moreso to get used to working with the language since it had been a long time since I worked with it.

I've got a repository [here](https://github.com/jtpeller/csort_test) that uses this library. Similar to my gosort repository, it measures the running times of the various sort functions.

## Important notes

There are likely bad practices in this library, since I'm both getting reacquainted with C/C++, and I've never built a library before.

These may be fixed over time, or maybe not.
